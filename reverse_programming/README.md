## Reverse programming

When browsing your target's deleted data you have managed to recover an interesting source file, called *encrypt.py*, here are the contents:

```
import binascii

# New encryption algorithm, will be used to encrypt secret messages. Keys are going to consist of 5 letters, lowercase.
def encrypt(message, key="t0T@l1y_S3cURe"):
    i = 0
    encr = []
    for char in message:
        encr.append(str(ord(char) ^ ord(key[i])))
        i += 1
        if i == len(key):
            i = 0
    encr = [int(xor) + 3*len(message) - len(key) for xor in encr]
    encr = [(xor//3 + 10)*3 if xor % 3 == 0 else xor for xor in encr]
    encr = [encr[i//2] if i % 2 == 0 else encr[(i//2)] + 5 for i in range(0, len(encr)*2)]
    encr = "".join(chr(xor) for xor in encr)
    encr = binascii.hexlify(bytes(encr, encoding="utf-8"))
    return encr
```

Based on the comment you believe breaking the encryption will be crucial in proving the insecurity of your target. In order to achieve that, you must create a decryption algorithm.

#### Tasks

Your first task is to decrypt messages encrypted with the default key. Your next task is to decrypt messages with a randomly generated key, using the hint given in the comment.

#### Example solution

Message *b'7378c383c388676ce2829fe282a46469c29ac29fc2bdc382c2a2c2a7c284c289595e7ec283c280c2856d726f74595e565bc299c29e797ec292c297c28ec2935c617075c2b9c2bec29bc2a04c51767bc2a2c2a7c291c296'* encrypted with the default key should be decrypted to *Youâ€™re as young as you feel.*. The decrypted sentence is the answer.

The key is the answer.
