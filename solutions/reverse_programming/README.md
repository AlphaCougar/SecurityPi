## Solution

#### Decryption

Decryption algorithm is present in the *decrypt.py* file.

#### Key cracking

No solution uploaded so far. To solve the challenge, one must locally try all key combinations (there are 26 characters to chose from - abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz - and the key length is 5, which makes 26^5 = 11881376 combinations), decrypt the message and determine which decryption is a valid sentence (for example by using a dictionary with English words).

#### Custom client

Custom client to automate the process of connecting, decryption etc. is present in the *client.py* file.
