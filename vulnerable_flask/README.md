## Vulnerable Flask

Flask is a lightweight web application framework, with the purpose to provide core features for developers, but leave every other bit for them to implement. Using it requires a lot of experience, especially to make websites secure.

A student from a local university has paid you to help him find vulnerabilities in his new website. Given the fact he's a first year student, you suspect the website is quite vulnerable. Can you find out what's wrong with it?

#### Tasks

Find the *flag* (32-characters long string). You can access the website via a browser, after starting the challenge. The address is the IP address used to connect to the PI. The port is 5000. Example connection - *http://169.254.69.188:5000*

#### Example solution

Example flag - *domdpjbknopzhjusmxstjcvvgonizjyn*. The flag is the answer.
