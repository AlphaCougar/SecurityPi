## Configuring Raspbian

Each text file within this folder provides short instructions on installing specific features which are present in the PI's custom image. This is to help reproduce steps needed to create the image, in case of any errors that has to be fixed or changes that have to be introduced.

Proper documentation will follow after the final build of the image.
