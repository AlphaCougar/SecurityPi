## *phpMyAdmin* shell exploit

You were asked to review the system security of a recently built learning-platform for Raspberry-Pi.

You have heard from many trustworthy sources that the DevOps working on the project are extremely lazy and, among other security issues introduced through their negligence, they gave access to the folder with website files to every user registered on the system. You believe this could be the crucial flaw in their system and decide to focus on exploiting it first.

#### Task

Find the *flag* (32-characters long string). You can access the website via a browser. The address is the IP address used to connect to the PI. Example connection - *http://169.254.69.188*

#### Example solution

Example flag - *domdpjbknopzhjusmxstjcvvgonizjyn*. The flag is the answer.
