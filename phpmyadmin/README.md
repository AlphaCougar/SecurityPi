## phpMyAdmin shell exploit

*phpMyAdmin* is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web. You were asked to review the system security of a recently built learning-platform for Raspberry-Pi, which has *phpMyAdmin* installed.

You have heard from many trustworthy sources that the DevOps working on the project are extremely lazy and, among other security issues introduced through their negligence, have given access to the folder with website files to every user registered on the system. You believe this could be the crucial flaw in their system and decide to focus on exploiting it.

#### Task

Find the *flag* (32-characters long string). You can access the main website via a browser. The address is the IP address used to connect to the PI. Example connection - *http://169.254.69.188*

#### Example solution

Example flag - *domdpjbknopzhjusmxstjcvvgonizjyn*. The flag is the answer.
